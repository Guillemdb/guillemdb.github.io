avoid almost any firewall. Using a recently discovered scanning technique based on network timeouts,
I created a malicious jupyter notebook hosted on GitHub. Any person accessing the GitHub page
where the notebook was hosted would involuntarily send requests to all its internal network,
and send the time-out times to my own database. Then I used an ML model to infer the OS/service
running on each port and some hardware configurations of the targeted network.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Designed and built an AlphaZero-like agent for neural architecture search to classify
CIFAR10. It achieved top 15% accuracy on the Kaggle leaderboard after 6 hours of training,
and ranked top #5 in Kaggle after 48 hours of training.</p></li>
<li><p>Designed a library to embed interactive dashboards, and plots developed in any Python
visualization library as html iframes. I implemented a proof of concept that cut in half the
development time of complex visualizations, and it allowed my team to add new complex
features with minimal effort.</p></li>
<li><p>I helped design, developed and maintained a production-grade tool to analyze at
scale thousands of commit time series, and implemented the visualizations to
integrate it with the company product.</p></li>
<li><p>Designed, developed and maintained a library that allows to execute any gym environment
in a distributed fashion, and implemented an API to make gym compatible with planning algorithms.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I proposed and implemented a novel approach to minimize packet loss in TCP networks.
This allowed me to help veteran University researchers specialized in networking to collaborate
with the department of differential equations.</p></li>
<li><p>Founded a company and studied OSS &amp; community-based business models, and business management.</p></li>
<li><p>I helped design PCB, and microchip layout optimization algorithms.</p></li>
<li><p>I reproduced a recently published Epidemiology paper that used econometrics
to model antibiotic resistance. I Designed and built an interactive application
to automate all the study, so it could be replicated on data from different hospitals in
under 5 minutes.</p></li>

<li><p>In 2017 I hacked myself into the first position in the OpenAI gym leaderboard, and scored #1
on several Atari games using sampling algorithms with no learning. That helped me find a sponsor to
implement a mu-zero architecture (published by DeepMind in 2019) using my own planning algorithms
instead of MCTS. I generated a dataset of 500GB of top performing trajectories to train it,
and I was incapable on making it converge using a single GPU.</p></li>
