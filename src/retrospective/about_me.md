### Who are you?
I'm a human being trying to figure out how to live a happy life. My greatest achievement is being
surrounded by a lot of people that love me back as much as I love them, and that I can trust 100%.

I've been blessed with an uncommon set of skills, and I've been lucky enough to be born in a place
where I could train and develop them freely. I am very grateful for that, and I try to use my skills
in a way that they can benefit as many people as possible.

I'm not smart enough to understand what life is about, but I wanna live my life so when it's over I
can look back and say: "Wow, that trip was really worth it!"

### What do you like?
* Sharing my time with nice people.
* Challenge myself to learn new things.
* Doing stuff on my computer.
* Hacking*  
* Music. I don't go deep into it because I am afraid it will make me loose interest in computers.

### What are your strengths?
#### Skills
* I learn stuff extremely fast, specially if it's related to science.
* I'm good abstracting concepts and relating them to each other.
* I run mental simulations on geometrical abstractions of complex systems to make educated guesses.
  
#### Personality
* I'm patient, perseverant, and I work hard on my mental discipline.
* I'm extremely stubborn, but I learned to change my mind when data and experiments prove me wrong.
* I only measure myself by how well I am following my principles.

### What are your weaknesses?

#### Skills
* I don't know how to do any kind of exams. Whenever I felt that the goal of a task 
  is to rank myself with respect to others, I consistently underperformed.
* I  don't enjoy negociations. But I've read a bunch of books on the topic, and I've 
  learned that it's important to clarify the expectations of the parties to make a great
  business deal. For that reason I like to be very specific about terms and conditions, and 
  to make sure all options are assessed before I decide to sign any agreements.

#### Personality
* Everything gets boring really fast. Only extremely difficult challenges motivate me.
* I haven't figured out yet how to properly value my work. I am still navigating the grey area 
  between impostor syndrome and being too overconfident.
* Sometimes I get impatient, and it's hard for me to step back and give people the time 
  they need for processing information that is too obvious to me.
* I set myself very high standards (probably too high), and I judge myself 
  too hard when I fail to meet them.

### What upsets you?
* I have worked so hard to learn everything I know, and I get frustrated when I feel people don´t 
  value my skills because I don´t have followed the path they would expect. That usually entails 
  lower salaries compared to my colleagues, who followed a different education path, and are as 
  experts in their fields as I am in mine.
  
* Struggling so much to find a way to offer stability to my partners and compensate them fairly.

* Living without being faithful to my principles.

### What scares you?
* End up regretting all the sacrifices I made to live my life up to my standards.

* Building something that becomes more harmful than beneficial.

#### To deal with Engineering
- **Information should be free**.

*The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) 
in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed "hacking". However, the defining
characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. programming), 
but the manner in which it is done and whether it is something exciting and meaningful.
