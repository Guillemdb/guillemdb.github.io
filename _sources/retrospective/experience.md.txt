My timeline
:::

#### Engineering Mindset - (Junior 2008 - 2009)
:::{admonition} Richard P. Feynman 
:class: note
*You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. 
  I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. 
  It's their mistake, not my failing.*
:::

#### Learning to learn - (Regular 2010 - 2013)
:::{admonition} Richard P. Feynman 
:class: note
*Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, 
  irreverent and original manner possible.*
:::

#### Creativity and Innovation - (Advanced 2014 - 2016)
:::{admonition} Richard P. Feynman 
:class: note
*First you guess. Don't laugh, this is the most important step. 
    Then you compute the consequences. Compare the consequences to experience. 
    If it disagrees with experience, the guess is wrong. In that simple statement 
    is the key to science. It doesn't matter how beautiful your guess is or how 
    smart you are or what your name is. If it disagrees with experience, it's wrong. 
    That's all there is to it.*
:::

#### Execution and communication - (Senior 2017 - 2019)
:::{admonition} Richard P. Feynman 
:class: note
*Experiment is the sole judge of the validity of any idea.*
:::

#### Leading by example - (Lead 2020 - present)
:::{admonition} Richard P. Feynman 
:class: note
*Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on.*
:::

### Engineering Mindset

*Able to do only simple tasks. He needs constant attention from a senior, work needs to be often reviewed.*

#### Achievements
* Second best grades among all my classmates, even though I was very bad a doing exams.
* I had a lot of fun, I met a lot of new people, and I was partying a lot.

#### Communicate with your mentor and present them with work

* I Completed some courses even after failing all the exams, because I aced all the projects & labs way beyond expectation.
* I was taking private math lessons.

#### Willing to help when needed
* I was teaching my classmates after-hours and helping them with their lab assignments. 

### Learning to learn
*Able to do average tasks, but no designs or bigger changes. Is able to work 
independently, with limited attention of seniors. To become regular, junior must:*

#### Finish at least 3 difficult tasks with evaluation above expectation

1. Designed and built a printed circuit board that controlled programmable timers and LED displays.

2. Built a 20$ antenna with a Pringles can and hacked Wifis 1km away. I set up a 
  mesh network to distribute it from my laptop, so my friends could play video games 
  with lower ping and higher bandwidth.
  
3. Hacked the dorm’s system so my friends and I could have unlimited Internet access.
  
4. I managed my family portfolio of 50k$ using value-investing techniques, active portfolio 
  management strategies, and Forex automated trading algorithms written in Java. I lost 10K the 
   first week, but I managed to finish the year with +25% returns on a down-trend market using 
   only long positions. I stopped “investing” afterwards.

#### Clearly communicate with your mentor and present them with work
* Convinced a professor to raise my grade from 3.9/10 to 5/10 even though my exam 
  was wrong. Nobody else got him to raise their grade (not even from 4.95 to 5).

#### Work presence is stable; willing to help when needed
* I was teaching my classmates after-hours and helping them with their lab assignments.
* Teaching math to a high school student. From avg grade of 3/10 to 8.5/10 .
* In League Of Legends I played a role that involved understanding the big picture and actively 
  giving support to my teammates.
* I did all the analysis required for the MBA final thesis of a friend. It was in exchange for 
  50$ and a pizza because she was overwhelmed working and studying at the same time.

### Creativity and Innovation
Able to do difficult tasks, with little help and consultations of a dedicated senior. 
To become advanced, a regular must:

#### Have at least 6 difficult tasks completed
1. Top 3% League of Legends player.
2. Founded a startup with my brother and a friend (Airbnb for renting boats). I designed the MVP, 
   contributed to its development, and supervised contractors.
3. Set up an OpenNebula cluster on the University servers, and I learned how to manage it remotely.
4. Developed a framework for building and composing interactive dashboards on the Jupyter notebook.
5. Developed a pipeline to benchmark and compare optimization algorithms, and analyze the results 
   using interactive dashboards.
6. All my college assignments were implemented in Jupyter notebooks, even the 
  ones that didn't require us to code.
7. Bachelor thesis: An interactive dashboard app in Jupyter. It extracted
   features from correlation matrices of different financial assets using graph theory and physics.
8. I had some of my professors in Facebook, and I was discussing with them their research, and the 
  latest publications in their respective fields.

#### Think in big picture, predict consequences, take care about all aspects of a task  
* I started planning what I wanted to do with my life in the long run.

#### Clearly communicate across the team, being able to present work in large groups, as well as present reasonable and clear arguments for own ideas
* Helping teachers beta-test their teaching materials & suggesting them new tools and techniques.
* Presented my first talk ever at EuroPython to force myself to improve my communication in English.
* Professors asked me to re-use my college presentations and incorporate them in the official 
  teaching material.

#### Bring fresh ideas and directions for our research
* Implemented a working PoC of a sophisticated fingerprinting technique that could
  avoid almost any firewall. Using a recently discovered scanning technique based on network timeouts, 
  I created a malicious jupyter notebook hosted on GitHub. Any person accessing the GitHub page 
  where the notebook was hosted would involuntarily send requests to all its internal network, 
  and send the time-out times to my own database. Then I used an ML model to infer the OS/service 
  running on each port and some hardware configurations of the targeted network.
  
* Reproduced a recently published paper on network traffic estimations. I also trained an ML 
  model to approximate solutions to the equations proposed in the paper, and I achieved 20%+ lower
  error rate.
  
* Researched how to use ML models to improve genetic algorithms, 
  and how to use genetic algorithms to train ML models.

* Had fun writing Python programs to simulate physical systems, and calibrating 
  jump-diffusion stochastic models for pricing Options.
  
* I was mining financial data, writing my own backtesting libraries, and 
  researching ML-based trading strategies.

### Execution and communication

*Able to do all tasks, even the most difficult ones. Thinks independently, 
leader just confirms their solutions. To become a senior, advanced must:*

#### Always fulfill tasks with expected quality and on time 
* I’ve done 2 full time jobs & independent research at the same time. 
  - Member of a research team in Univ. UMH (Spain) [Part time]
  - Research Assistant University of Dubai [Part time]
  - AI researcher at source{d} [Full time]
  - Freelance Data Scientist [Part  time]
  - Open source contributions, papers, talks and workshops [Free time]
* Scored above expectations in all my performance reviews.
* Always collaborated with other teams (Product, Management, DevOps & Infra, UX...)

#### Able to do all tasks, even the most difficult ones
* Designed and built an AlphaZero-like agent for neural architecture search to classify 
  CIFAR10. It achieved top 15% accuracy on the Kaggle leaderboard after 6 hours of training, 
  and ranked top #5 in Kaggle after 48 hours of training.
* Designed a library to embed interactive dashboards, and plots developed in any Python 
  visualization library as html iframes. I implemented a proof of concept that cut in half the 
  development time of complex visualizations, and it allowed my team to add new complex 
  features with minimal effort.  
  
* I helped design, developed and maintained a production-grade tool to analyze at 
  scale thousands of commit time series, and implemented the visualizations to 
  integrate it with the company product.
  
* Designed, developed and maintained a library that allows to execute any gym environment 
in a distributed fashion, and implemented an API to make gym compatible with planning algorithms.
  
#### Be able to mentor juniors in the team - is reliable and respected
* I was teaching my team (Masters and PhD students) to code more 
  efficiently & solve bugs faster, while advising them on their respective 
  research/data science projects.
* At source{d}, I managed an extremely talented junior ML engineer in a 2 person team.
* Active contributor & co-organizer of ~25 events in our local data-science community. 
  ML tutorials, presentations and workshops.
* I attended as an invited speaker to several universities & Python conferences.

#### Be able to design, present and iterate difficult tasks, including cross-discipline communication
* I proposed and implemented a novel approach to minimize packet loss in TCP networks. 
  This allowed me to help veteran University researchers specialized in networking to collaborate
  with the department of differential equations. 
* Founded a company and studied OSS & community-based business models, and business management.
* I helped design PCB, and microchip layout optimization algorithms.
* I reproduced a recently published Epidemiology paper that used econometrics 
  to model antibiotic resistance. I Designed and built an interactive application 
  to automate all the study, so it could be replicated on data from different hospitals in 
  under 5 minutes.
  
#### Bring fresh ideas and directions for our work / research

* In 2017, I tested our planning algorithms on the OpenAI gym leaderboard, and scored #1 
  on several Atari games using sampling algorithms instead of training RL agents. That helped me find a sponsor to 
  implement a mu-zero architecture (published by DeepMind in 2019) using my own planning algorithms
  instead of MCTS. I generated a dataset of 500GB of top performing trajectories to train it, 
  and I was incapable on making it converge using a single GPU.

### Leading by example

*Exceptional person selected from the best Seniors. Responsible for the project and 
people in their team. To become a lead, a senior must:*

#### Be able to lead a team, respecting schedules and prioritizing tasks

* I participated for free as an AI expert in a training program. I coached different teams of 
  young data scientists that were building an MVP for a startup idea.
* Only employee, and de-facto CEO of Fragile Technologies. I designed and iterated an Open Source 
  business model, and defined the internal communication process and structure of our team.
* I am currently teaching a team of 5 apprentices to become successful AI researchers & engineers. 
  We are collaboratively creating an Open Source engineering course.

#### Represent the company in public - at conferences, streams, gatherings etc.

* Advisory board member & Honorific CTO of a startup (building an automated water 
  management system). I architected & designed their complete tech stack, and I helped 
  them negotiate with big water companies.
* I was part of the advisory board of a Biotech startup. I helped them package and 
  distribute a dataset of proteins to help speed up the work of a Coronavirus research team.
  
#### Attract new people to our projects

* I convinced a diverse group of extremely talented people to work with me on our company project
  as co-founders and advisors.

#### Keep on innovating
* Helped CTOs and Machine Learning leads of big companies to understand better the current 
  trends in AI, and discussed with them how to better integrate ML into their businesses
