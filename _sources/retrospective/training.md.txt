### Engineering Mindset

#### Processing speed 
  - I could read in Spanish at 800-1000 words per minute, which is when the 
  brain starts transforming what you read into a "mental movie" in order to keep up with all 
  the information that it's receiving.
  - I started meditating regularly.  

#### Abstractions
  - ~Grad level.
  - I was doing for fun all the different kinds of IQ tests that I could find.

#### Relationships/Geometry
Simple analogies like electrical-current water. 

#### Mental models
- A bit of chess & Harmonic oscillator.

#### Resiliency
- Studying 4 months of Physics course in one week.

### Learning to Learn

#### Processing speed 
  - Memory: Training speed and capacity (like how many numbers/words I could remember, 
  and how fast I could memorize them)
  - Reading speed: ~120 words in English. In Spanish, I could read Asimov's Foundation in one day.

#### Abstractions
  - Summarizing technical texts.
  - Re-writing technical texts from different perspectives.
  - Other study techniques.
    
#### Relationships/Geometry
  - Creating mind maps
  - Defining analogies between different technical topics   
  - I learned about representing graphs in different spaces.
    
#### Mental models
  - Defining analogies between different technical topics 
  - Explaining technical stuff to non-technical people.
  - I optimized for minimizing the time spend studying. 
    for exams, and overall time spent in college physically, taking into account 
    all the factors I could think of.
  - Mental visualization: I could mentally walk through every pixel of the League of Legends' map.  
    
#### Resiliency
  
  I Forced myself to learn on my own complex topics under pressure as fast as possible. 
  I didn't assist to any lecture university lecture, and studied everything one week before the exam.
  
  At first, it was a complete disaster, but during my last year in college I was able to study everything 
  on my way(train) to the exam. After a lot of effort, I managed to pass all my exams in the first try,
  while consistently getting a -3 points (out of 10) deviation from the grade I was aiming for.

### Creativity and Innovation

#### Processing speed 
  - I became comfortable watching video lectures on all different kinds of topics at 2x speed.

#### Abstractions
  - Plots: I was coding visualizations of different mathematical concepts and forcing myself to mentally
    reproduce them. Thanks to that, when I was given mathematical formulas, I could form a consistent 
    mental model without having to manipulate mathematical expressions, nor code the plots every time.
  - Simple datasets: I was trying to mentally plot different types of simple tabular datasets.
  - Integrating knowledge by creating my own mental map to relate what
    I knew at the time with our AI research.
  - I watched hundreds of hours of talks and videos about data science and Python.    


#### Relationships/Geometry
  - I was actively improving my interdisciplinary understanding by challenging myself to tackle problems
    using tools developed in a different area. (For example, Thermoeconomics, which is the understanding of 
    markets using statistical mechanics and thermodynamics)
  - I was learning about all the different ways that Fourier transforms can be used to tackle
    different kinds of problems.
  - I was actively pushing myself to solve different problems using simulations and Monte Carlo sampling.

#### Mental models
  - I spent a huge amount of time trying to mentally reproduce the simulations
      we were running in the laptop, so we could make guesses of how changing different parameters 
      would affect the behavior of our agents.
  - To understand better our own sampling algorithms, we started forcing our brain to think and plan
    the same way our algorithm does.
  
  - We run our algorithms on all kinds of different state spaces and learned how
    to create mental models for all of them.
    
  - We challenged ourselves to tackle and solve as many problems as possible by approaching them as an
    exploration vs exploitation tradeoff.
  - I spent hundreds of hours deeply understanding all the different parameters and changes 
    in implementation of our algorithms, and how they affected the performance of our agent in the Atari games.
    We challenged ourselves to explain every perceivable aspect about the gameplay of the agents using the framework 
    of statistical mechanics.
    
#### Resiliency
  - I was always forcing myself to multitask working on several projects that 
    were out of my comfort zone.
  - I went to therapy and learned how to understand myself and other people better.  

### Execution and communication

#### Processing speed 
  - To compensate for the decline in processing speed due to age that was soon to come, 
  I started working hard on understanding mistakes, and developing best practices, so I could avoid 
  repeating mistakes.
    
#### Abstractions 
  - I was catching up with the AI/RL literature and understanding all the 
    concepts that were used in the academic literature.
    
#### Relationships/Geometry
  - I was working hard on finding relationships between everything I was learning and 
    everything that I already knew.
  - I kept on improving the guessed metrics that I was using when thinking like our algorithms do.
    
#### Mental models
  - I implemented all the RL agents I could find to train on Atari games, and I challenged myself to
    explain their behavior the same way I did with our own agents.
  - Improved the boundary conditions, latent space, and heuristics that 
    I was using in my mental planning algorithm.  

#### Resiliency
  - I became comfortable working ~14 hours a day during very long periods of time: 
    doing a full time job, being part of a research team in two different universities, 
    doing independent research, and preparing talks and workshops at the same time.
  - I got used to working while traveling around constantly.  
  - I greatly increased my tolerance to criticism and lack of resources.

### Leading by example

#### Processing speed 
  - I not only got my ADHD diagnosed and treated, but I also quit smoking weed like there is no tomorrow. 
    That effectively tripled the amount of work I could do, and improved its overall quality.
    
#### Abstractions 
  - I started focusing on integrating business/product vision and OSS 
    development standards into my daily life.
    
#### Relationships/Geometry
  - Focused on using everything I know to build a sustainable Open Source company.
    
#### Mental models
  - I guess stuff about anything I understand (similarly to what a chess master does to "guess/feel"
    how good a given position is, and what are the best next moves subconsciously).

#### Resiliency
  - I took the Covid lockdown as a chance to test my limits, understand what I could do, 
    and how much work I could consistently output.
  - I learned how to feel comfortable in meetings.
