<summary><h3>About me</h3></summary>
<br>
I am a data scientist and a Python developer. I love solving machine learning challenges, teaching, learning and coding.
I am a PyData Mallorca co-organizer because I enjoy contributing to the Open Source community.
<br>
I've enjoyed Barcelona, Murcia, Madrid, Paris, and London, but I finally settled down in Palma, where I grew up.
