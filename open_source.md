### Software libraries
This is a list of the Open Source projects that I am currently developing and maintaining. For an exhaustive list 
of all my projects and contributions check my [GitHub](https://github.com/Guillemdb) profile.

#### [flogging](https://github.com/FragileTech/flogging)
* Offers nice logging formatting.
* Allows collecting structured logging as json files.

#### [ML Ops Quickstart (mloq)](https://github.com/FragileTech/ml-ops-quickstart)
* Command line tool for quickly configuring Python projects, either interactively or using yaml files.
* Automates the configuration of the project packaging, documentation, style checker, linter, 
CI pipeline and Docker containers.

#### [plangym](https://github.com/FragileTech/plangym)
* Provides a unified API for the most relevant Reinforcement Learning environments.
* Allows using RL environments for planning by accessing and modifying the simulation state.
* Built in parallelization of planning environments using multiprocessing and ray.


#### [fragile](https://github.com/FragileTech/fragile)
* Framework for developing FractalAI-based algorithms.
* Implements planning algorithms that outperform MCTS by several orders of magnitude
and also work in continuous action spaces.
* Integrates with plangym for sampling RL environments, and provides an API for function optimization.
* Includes all the necessary functionality for deploying the algorithms in a distributed
fashion and creating datasets of high quality trajectories.


### Tutorials and learning resources

These are some tutorials and courses on data science and software engineering.

#### [fragile-guide](https://fragile-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* Introductory course to Git and collaborating in GitHub.
* Tutorials for setting up the Python environment, the style guide we are using in our libraries.
* A brief introduction to Python data structures.

#### [Aprendiendo como aprenden las máquinas](https://github.com/PyDataMallorca/PyConES2019_Aprendiendo_como_aprenden_las_maquinas) (PyData Mallorca)
* Introductory notebooks explaining how different machine learning algorithms work.
* It covers linear regression, logistic regression, regularization and decision trees.

#### [Introducción a data science in Python](https://github.com/PyDataMallorca/FTW2019_Introduccion_a_data_science_en_Python) (PyData Mallorca)
* Introductory workshop to that introduces the most relevant tools used in data science projects.
* It covers: jupyter, numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn.

#### [Introduction to data science](https://github.com/PyDataMallorca/WS_Introduction_to_data_science) (PyData Mallorca)
* Brief description of the meaning, problems and uses of Data Science.
* Resolution step by step of one simple classification problem, using a Data Science environment based on Python.
