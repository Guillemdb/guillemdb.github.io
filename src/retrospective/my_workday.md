## My ideal work day

I wake up and make some coffee, and I drink it while I check the email. I do some yoga and take a shower.

I log in to the VPN, and set up the computer. I’m starting to stream my working day to my paid subscribers, and answering their questions. 

Meanwhile, I analyse on an interactive dashboard the predictions about the training metrics of an ongoing experiment. The experiment involves an AGI agent running in a 100k node cluster, and it’s already beating the latest paper we are replicating with a tenth of the original computing cost . 

I have time to discuss the experimental setup with the viewers because the whole experiment took me three hours to code and deploy. The discussion is truly insightful because they are already building on top of my work:
All the fundamental principles are online for free
All my research code is free: MIT licensed, thoroughly tested and documented.
The tools I use and all the resources to master them are free: Docs, tutorials, and even some courses.
Some of them pay a bit a month to get access to exclusive content
The craziest ones pay a lot 

What slows you down? 
What boosts your motivation?
