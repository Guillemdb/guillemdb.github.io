## About this project

This is a personal self-retrospective written for therapeutic purposes. Its goal is to help
me understand who I am today, and what I've done during the past 12 years to get where I currently am.

For the sake of simplicity, I omitted information related to my work on Fractal AI, and my
ongoing collaboration with Good AI.
